// [4/22/2023 8:33 PM] Clive App - Guy: No I can't but on the home page, in the middle where the word Akatabo was you put the logo, I just wanted to tell you to remove it or you can keep the word Akatabo
// [4/22/2023 8:36 PM] Clive App - Guy: Let's just keep this. This will be the last comment for now. Let me inform these guys about processing your second installment as well
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: 1. The profile screen . The options that are supposed to be editable are not
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: 2 . The sign up screen . The login button is gradient yes but the login word on my phone was being displayed half way ..more like being cut
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: 3 . I thought on the part of recovering password , a user should be send an otp to their email , that they verify within the app . Same for the first sign up
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: 4 . The login or sign up  button on one of the other screens is still red ..maybe it's the password recovery one
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: 5 . I'd like to know if firebase will be connected . It's not hard to connect tbh .
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: We can use it as our database for now .
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: So that the logic in the app is working .
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: 7. Wonder if the suggestion we put in for the splash screen were considered.  It doesn't even loss
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: Load *
// [4/23/2023 9:37 AM] Clive App - Guy: Also I didn't see the screen for selecting the level
